## Items List

A Next.js React Web App for keeping track of items and being able to mark them completed as you go, with the ability to remove all completed, or singular, items.

### Getting Started

After installing the dependencies with `yarn install`, run the development server with `yarn dev`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Guidance

- Enter an item into the text field (75 characters or less) and either press the 'Enter'/'Return' key on your keyboard or the 'Add Item to List' button to add an item to the list.
- Click on an item's text to mark it as completed (red line through it) or not completed.
- Slide left on an item to bring up the single-item delete button. Slide to the right to re-hide the delete button (the button will also re-hide automatically after 10 seconds).
- Use the 'Delete Completed Items' button to delete all items marked as completed (have a red line through them).
- Use the 'Change List Type (Bullets or Numbers)' button to switch between bullet point or numbered lists.
