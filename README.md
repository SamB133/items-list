## Items List

A Next.js React Web App for keeping track of items and being able to mark them completed as you go. You also have the ability to remove all completed, or singular, items from the list.

### Access

### Guidance

- Enter an item into the text field (75 characters or less) and either press the 'Enter'/'Return' key on your keyboard or the 'Add Item to List' button to add an item to the list.
- Click on an item's text to mark it as completed (red line through it) or not completed.
- Slide left on an item to bring up the single-item delete button. Slide to the right to re-hide the delete button (the button will also re-hide automatically after 10 seconds).
- Use the 'Delete Completed Items' button to delete all items marked as completed (have a red line through them).
- Use the 'Change List Type (Bullets or Numbers)' button to switch between bullet point or numbered lists.
